				<h1>MISSION</h1>
				<img src="images/Overview.png" />
				<p><b>Planet LAB</b> is a gamified social network for learning science and helping Planet Earth.  We connect learners to hands-on projects and real research opportunities; we help every learner to engage in the world's biggest mysteries.<br><br>

				<b>Planet LAB</b> crowd-sources existing content and projects from a range partners--museums, zoos, hospitals, universities and environmental organizations.  By connecting organizations and schools, we deliver hands-on learning and citizen science experiences to every classroom. Our dynamic, social platform that allows kids to make valuable contributions to their community and their world.<br>

				Right now, few U.S. students are capable in science at their grade level <a href="http://www.changetheequation.org/infographic-science-sos" target="_blank">(only 32% in 4th grade, and only 20% in 12th)</a>and <a href="http://successfulstemeducation.org/resources/national-survey-science-and-mathematics-education" target="_blank">over 60% of teachers report that they feel unprepared to teach science</a>. In order to prepare the next generation of innovators for tomorrow, we need to connect students to fun and engaging learning opportunities today.<br><br>

				As we build a global <b>Planet LAB</b> for youth, we imagine a world where every young person can become a scientist, an inventor, or an engineer. We want to engage learners to ask the questions that most fascinate them...and to find their own answers.</p><br>

				<h1>CO-DESIGN</h1>
				<p>To design Planet LAB, we interacted with over 500 Chicago Public School students, teacher-leaders, and STEM education leaders from a range of municipal organizations (like community garden networks, museums, and environmental education programs).</p><br>

				<p>Our co-designers identified a number of pain points: <b>youth</b>  told us that they wanted to connect service experiences and STEM learning, and to work creatively on teams to learn and <b>teachers</b>  told us that they found a lot of STEM education resources on-line, but they are "siloed" and not searchable. The teachers wanted access to learning projects based on search terms like season of year, standards, materials used, and cost. Curriculum producers and teacher trainers wanted to be able to track the impact of their learning resources, better understanding how teachers were actually delivering projects and content in a classroom contexts.</p><br>

				<p>Our advisors came from a range of organizations, including: <a href="http://www.activetrans.org/" target="_blank">Active Transportation Alliance</a>, <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/conservation_outreachgreenprograms/svcs/greencorps_chicago.html" target="_blank">Greencorps Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.naturemuseum.org/" target="_blank">Peggy Notebaert Museum</a>, <a href="http://agcchicago.org/" target="_blank">Academy for Global Citizenship</a>, <a href="http://stemchicago.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Chicago STEM Pathways Cooperative</a>, <a href="http://fpdcc.com/" target="_blank">Forest Preserve District of Cook County</a>, <a href="http://www.gpcommunitycouncil.org/index.html" target="_blank">Garfield Park Community Council</a>, <a href="http://westtownbikes.org/" target="_blank">West Town Bikes</a>, <a href="http://www.twobridges.org/" target="_blank">Two Bridges Neighborhood Council</a>.</p><br>

				<h1>TEAM</h1>
				<p>Our team combines experience in curriculum development and learning research, software engineering, and educational game development. We are joined by dedicated professionals who volunteer their time on the development of Planet LAB through our relationship with <a href="http://www.astcorporation.com/" target="_blank">AST Corporation</a></p><br>

				<h4><a href="http://www.freedomgames.org/#!start-up-team/c1cd5" target="_blank">Read more about our backgrounds here ></a></h4><br>

				<p>Planet LAB's team first convened through the Center for Neighborhood Technology's Urban <a href="http://www.cnt.org/2013/11/05/cnt-competition-produces-mobile-apps-that-reinvent-chicago/" target="_blank">Sustainability Apps Hackathon</a>, we went on to win first place in the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2014/apr/mayor-emanuel-announces-winners-of-cleanweb-challenge-driving-en.html" target="_blank"> City of Chicago Clean Web Challenge</a>, and recognition from the <a href="https://www.isteconference.org/2014/" target="_blank">International Society for Technology and Education.</a></p><br>

				<p>We created a non-profit organization, Freedom Games, in order to design educational technologies in partnership with youth and teacher-leaders. Please <a href="mailto:info@freedomgames.org">contact us</a> to learn more about our work and about volunteering with us.</p><br>
