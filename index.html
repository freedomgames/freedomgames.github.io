                <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
				
                <p><b>The Planet Earth</b> is the biggest experiment ever known...at least by Earthling scientists.  What are the farthest reaches of the Universe, and could we travel there someday?  How deep is the deepest place on the Ocean floor...and what exactly lives down there?   What are we made of?  How does it all work together in a living system?  And what can we do for our healthy creativity to discover new things?  These are questions that every kid should get to ask and explore, at school, at home...and at work as citizen scientists.<br><br>

                    <b>Planet Lab</b> is a fun and social learning network that helps the next generation of young scientists learn about Earth’s air, water, energy, food systems and medicines…and the mysteries that lie beyond the horizon line.<br><br>

                    <b>The Problem</b> is that kids are loosing important opportunities to play and learn in the world of science.<br><br>

                    Few U.S students are capable in science of their grade level (only 32% in 4th grade, only 20% in 12th). This partly a problem of teacher preparation: 61% of elementary educators feel poorly unprepared to teach science; only 31% of 8th grade math teachers majored in math.<br><br>

                    Right now, the average American kid spends about 7 hours a day watching screen media and only 30 minutes a day playing outside. With media up and creative play down, our kids are quickly becoming less active, more obese, and more likely to struggle with attention disorders—all problems that we might impact with elementary education in health and well-being. But right now, only 2.6 hours in school are spent on science...that's less than 22 minutes per day!<br><br>

                    <b>Inquiry-based Learning</b>, environmental education and hands-on tinkering are great ways to engage kids in learning science and core skills. In fact, schools with environmental education programs score higher on math, reading, writing and listening tests.<br><br>

                    To build the next generation of creative problem solvers, we quickly need to expand successful environmental and natural science programs and support teachers to integrate project-based science and technology time with reading, writing and arithmetic. We need to find ways of integrating learning across home, school, and media contexts. We need to encourage kids to experiment and research everyday.<br><br>

                    As we build a global <b>Planet Lab</b> for kids, we imagine a world where every young person has access to high-quality, engaging STEM learning opportunities that honor the curiosity and ambitions of all young scientists. We aim to quickly increase the learning opportunities and learning materials needed for science engagement.<br><br>

											<p class='caption'>
												We asked over 500 youth in summer learning programs: "What STEM topics are important for you and your community?"  and "Where do you see opportunities for science around you?" In hands-on UX design workshops, youth created ideas for connecting to STEM to their hopes and concerns.

											<img src="images/slides/slide02.png" alt="CNT presentation-problem">
											<p class='caption'>
												Working with a team at CNT's Sustainability Hackathon, we pinpointed the problem that STEM curricula are "siloed" and hard to access. We prototyped a crowd-source encyclopedia that can make these resources available quickly to schools and families.

												Hands-on lessons engage multiple learning styles and make math and reading relevant.  Balloon mapping is an inexpensive technique that teaches geometry, physics, and community development skills.

											<p class='caption'>
												Science Assemblies allow organizations and schools to create multi-sited experiments that classrooms add observations to, from "Great Lakes Water Quality" to "Asthma and Air." By sharing a set of data collection standards, students and teachers can collaborate on real research.

												Standards-based education means that science-time must reinforce literacy and math basics. A fun multi-media player sets up learners for engaging with content and transcripts. Vocabulary, reading and review questions reinforce basic skills.
